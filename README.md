:exclamation: Note: <b>NO COPYRIGHTED ROM FILES ARE INCLUDED NOR WILL THEY BE. PLEASE DO NOT ASK FOR THEM.</b>

## BSD and Linux supplement

You will need the following libraries and buildtools (and their dependencies):
- SDL2
- wxWidgets 3.x
- OpenAL
- CMake
- Ninja (Recommended, but you can use a Makefile generator if you prefer)

On Ubuntu, you can install the required packages with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libwxgtk3.2-dev libopenal-dev ninja-build cmake
```

Open a terminal window, navigate to the PCem directory then enter:
### Linux/BSD
```
cmake -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
ninja
```

### Windows (MSYS2)
```
cmake -G "Ninja" -DMSYS=TRUE -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
ninja
```

then `./src/pcem` to run.

The Linux/BSD versions store BIOS ROM images, configuration files, and other data in `~/.pcem`

### Finding unused modules

If you want to see which objects are discarded by the linker, configure the
project with `-DENABLE_GC_SECTIONS=ON` and pipe the build output through
`scripts/unused_sections.py`:

```bash
cmake -DENABLE_GC_SECTIONS=ON -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
ninja |& python3 scripts/unused_sections.py
```

The script prints object files that were removed because none of their functions
were referenced by the XT-only build.

You can specify the Display Engine using `-DPCEM_DISPLAY_ENGINE=` The only valid option you have at this time is
wxWidgets 

The configure options are specified below. They are in the format of -D`Option`=`Value`. `Value` under here is the
default value.
```
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release : Generate release build. Recommended for regular use.
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug   : Compile with debugging enabled.
  -DUSE_NETWORKING=OFF       : Build with networking support.
  -DUSE_PCAP_NETWORKING=OFF  : Build with pcap networking support. (Needs USE_NETWORKING to compile) Requires libpcap.
  -DUSE_ALSA=OFF             : Build with support for MIDI output through ALSA. Requires libasound. (Linux Only)
  -DFORCE_X11=ON             : Enables a hack to force X11 on Wayland systems. See #128 for details. (Linux Only)
  -DPLUGIN_ENGINE=ON         : Build with plugin support. Builds libpcem-plugin-api and links PCem with it.
  -DENABLE_GC_SECTIONS=OFF   : Enable link-time removal of unused functions.
```

If you are using -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug, there are some more debug options you can enable if needed
```
  -DPCEM_SLIRP_DEBUG=OFF           : Build PCem with SLIRP_DEBUG debug output
  -DPCEM_RECOMPILER_DEBUG=OFF      : Build PCem with RECOMPILER_DEBUG debug output
  -DPCEM_NE2000_DEBUG=OFF          : Build PCem with NE2000_DEBUG debug output
  -DPCEM_EMU8K_DEBUG_REGISTERS=OFF : Build PCem with EMU8K_DEBUG_REGISTERS debug output
  -DPCEM_SB_DSP_RECORD_DEBUG=OFF   : Build PCem with SB_DSP_RECORD_DEBUG debug output
  -DPCEM_MACH64_DEBUG=OFF          : Build PCem with MACH64_DEBUG debug output
  -DPCEM_DEBUG_EXTRA=OFF           : Build PCem with DEBUG_EXTRA debug output
```

If you are using -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo, there are additional options you can do
```
  -DPCEM_RELDEB_AS_RELEASE=ON     : Builds RelWithDebInfo with debugging logging enabled when this is off
```

They are some extra modules you can add if you build with `-DUSE_EXPERIMENTAL=ON`. These modules are untested.
incomplete, and may or may not be in a future build of PCem. We do not provide builds with these enabled as
well. It is also possible they may not even build.
```
  -DUSE_EXPERIMENTAL_PGC=ON       : Build PCem with Professional Graphics Controller support.
  -DUSE_EXPERIMENTAL_PRINTER=ON   : Build PCem with Printer support. Requires freetype.
``` 
The menu is a pop-up menu in the Linux/BSD port. Right-click on the main window when mouse is not
captured.

CD-ROM support currently only accesses `/dev/cdrom`. It has not been heavily tested.

### 3D only cards
Hardware | Addl. Info 
--- | --- 
<b>3DFX Voodoo Graphics</b> <i>[[4]](#graphics-note-4)</i>| 3D accelerator. Widely supported in late 90s games.
<b>Obsidian SB50</b> <i>[[5]](#graphics-note-5)</i>| Voodoo with 2 TMUs
<b>3DFX Voodoo 2</b> <i>[[6]](#graphics-note-6)</i>| Improved Voodoo Graphics<br/>Higher clocks<br/>2 TMUs<br/>Triangle setup, etc.

#### Additional Notes
<a name="graphics-note-1">`[1]`</a> <b>Cirrus Logic GD-5434</b>: Real chip also supports 1MB configurations, however this is not currently supported in PCem.

<a name="graphics-note-2">`[2]`</a> <b>Diamond Stealth 3D 2000</b>: PCem emulates the ViRGE S3D engine in software. This works with most games I tried, but there may be some issues. The Direct3D drivers for the /325 are fairly poor (often showing as missing triangles), so use of the /DX instead is recommended.

<a name="graphics-note-3">`[3]`</a> <b>S3 ViRGE/DX</b>: The drivers that come with Windows are similar to those for the /325, however better ones do exist (try the 8-21-1997 version). With the correct drivers, many early Direct3D games work okay (if slowly).

<a name="graphics-note-4">`[4]`</a> <b>3DFX Voodoo Graphics</b>: PCem emulates this in software. The emulation is a lot faster than in v10 (thanks to a new dynamic recompiler) and should be capable of hitting Voodoo 1 performance on most machines when two render threads are used. As before, the emulated CPU is the bottleneck for most games. <br/><br/>PCem can emulate 6 and 8 MB configurations, but defaults to 4 MB for compatibility. It can also emulate the screen filter present on the original card, though this does at present have a noticeable performance hit.<br/><br/>Almost everything I've tried works okay, with a very few exceptions - Screamer 2 and Rally have serious issues.

<a name="graphics-note-5">`[5]`</a> <b>Obsidian SB50</b>: Drivers for this are a bit limited - the official drivers don't support 2 TMUs in Direct3D.

<a name="graphics-note-6">`[6]`</a> <b>3DFX Voodoo 2</b>: PCem can emulate both 8 and 12 MB configurations. It can also emulate 6 and 10 MB configurations (with 2MB framebuffer memory), which were never sold into the PC market but do exist for arcade systems.

## Sound Cards

Hardware | Notes
--- | ---
<b>PC speaker</b> | The standard beeper on all PCs. Supports samples/RealSound.
<b>Tandy PSG</b> | The Texas Instruments chip in the PCjr and Tandy 1000. Supports 3 voices plus noise. I reused the emulator in B-em for this (slightly modified). PCem emulates the differences between the SN76496 (PCjr and Tandy 1000), and the NCR8496 (currently assigned to the Tandy 1000HX). Maniac Mansion and Zak McKraken will only sound correct on the latter.
<b>Tandy PSSJ</b> | Used on the Tandy 1000SL/2, this clones the NCR8496, adding an addition frequency divider (did any software actually use this?) and an 8-bit DAC.
<b>PS/1 audio card</b> | An SN76496 clone plus an 8-bit DAC. The SN76496 isn't at the same address as PCjr/Tandy, so most software doesn't support it.
<b>Gameblaster</b> | The Creative Labs Gameblaster/Creative Music System, Creative's first sound card introduced in 1987. Has two Philips SAA1099, giving 12 voices of square waves plus 4 noise voices. In stereo!
<b>Adlib</b> | Has a Yamaha YM3812, giving 9 voices of 2 op FM, or 6 voices plus a rhythm section. PCem uses the DOSBox dbopl emulator.
<b>Adlib Gold</b> | OPL3 with YM318Z 12-bit digital section. Possibly some bugs (not a lot of software to test). The surround module is now emulated.
<b>Sound Blaster</b> <i>[[1]](#sound-note-1)</i> | See linked note for more details.
<b>Gravis Ultrasound</b> | 32 voice sample playback. Port address is fixed to 240, IRQ and DMA can be changed from the drivers. Emulation is improved significantly over previous versions.
<b>Windows Sound System</b> | 16-bit digital + OPL3. Note that this only emulates WSS itself, and should not be used with drivers from compatible boards with additional components (eg Turtle Beach Monte Carlo)
<b>Aztech Sound Galaxy Pro 16 AB (Washington)</b> | SB compatible + WSS compatible
<b>Innovation SSI-2001</b> | SID6581. Emulated using resid-fp. Board is fixed to port 280.
<b>Ensoniq AudioPCI (ES1371)<br/>Sound Blaster PCI 128</b> | Basic PCI sound card. Emulates Sound Blaster in software.

### Additional Notes
<a name="sound-note-1">`[1]`</a> <b>Sound Blaster</b>: Several Sound Blasters are emulated.
* SB v1.0 - The original. Limited to 22khz, and no auto-init DMA (can cause crackles sometimes).
* SB v1.5 - Adds auto-init DMA
* SB v2.0 - Upped to 41khz
* SB Pro v1.0 - Stereo with twin OPL2 chips.
* SB Pro v2.0 - Stereo with OPL 3 chip
* SB 16 - 16 bit stereo
* SB AWE32 - SB 16 + wavetable MIDI. This requires a ROM dump from a real AWE32.

All cards are set to Address 220, IRQ 7 and DMA 1 (and High DMA 5). IRQ and DMA can be changed for the SB16 & AWE32 in the drivers. The relevant SET line for autoexec.bat is `SET BLASTER = A220 I7 D1 Tx` - where Tx is T1 for SB v1.0, T3 for SB v2.0, T4 for SB Pro, and T6 for SB16.

AWE32 requires a ROM dump called `awe32.raw`. AWE-DUMP is a utility which can get a dump from a real card. Most EMU8000 functionality should work, however filters are not correct and reverb/chorus effects are not currently emulated.
